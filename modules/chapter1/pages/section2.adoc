:description: Step-by-step guide to deploying the Registry, ingesting a model, and connecting the Catalog.

[.lead]
*Theory is over. It is time to build.*

In this lab, you will take on the role of a **Lead Platform Engineer**. Your Data Science team has been downloading models randomly from Hugging Face. Your task is to establish order by deploying a **Private Model Registry** and forcing all future deployments to go through this governed gate.

[IMPORTANT]
.Prerequisites
====
* **Cluster Access:** You are logged into an OpenShift AI 3.0 cluster via terminal (`oc login`).
* **Permissions:** You have `cluster-admin` or sufficient namespace privileges.
* **Repository:** You have cloned the course repository:
  `git clone https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhoai3-registry.git`
  `cd rhoai3-registry/`
====

== Step 1: The Plumbing (Infrastructure)

The Model Registry is stateless. Before we can turn it on, we need two things: a **Brain** (Database) and a **Vault** (Object Storage).

We have provided a script that deploys a MySQL 8.0 instance and a MinIO object store into a new namespace called `rhoai-model-registry`.

. **Run the Setup Script:**
+
[source,bash]
----
./deploy/setup.sh
----

. **Verify the Pods:**
Ensure the database and storage are running before proceeding.
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get pods -n rhoai-model-registry
----
+
*Expected Output:*
----
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-5d8f7-xyz                   1/1     Running   0          45s
minio-7b9c2-abc                   1/1     Running   0          45s
model-registry-service-6f...      1/1     Running   0          20s
----

== Step 2: The Ingestion (Registering the "Gold" Model)

Now that the registry is running, it is empty. We need to populate it.

You will run a Python automation pipeline that mimics a secure supply chain:

 1.  **Downloads** the `granite-7b-lab` model from Hugging Face (or uses a cached local copy).
 2.  **Uploads** the weights to your private MinIO "Vault" (ensuring sovereignty).
 3.  **Registers** the metadata (Version 1.0.0, Author: You) into the MySQL "Brain."

. **Install Dependencies (Optional):**
If running locally, ensure you have the python clients installed.
+
[source,bash]
----
pip install -r deploy/registration/requirements.txt
----

. **Execute the Pipeline:**
+
[source,bash]
----
./deploy/run_pipeline.sh
----

. **Observe the Output:**
Watch the logs. You should see the "Handshake" happen:
+
[source,text]
----
> Connecting to Hugging Face... Done.
> Downloading 'granite-7b-lab'... Done.
> Uploading to Private MinIO Bucket (s3://private-models)... Success.
> Registering with Model Registry API...
> SUCCESS: Model Registered with ID: 12345
----

== Step 3: The Payoff (Connecting the Catalog)

At this moment, the model is safe in your registry, but the Data Scientists cannot see it yet. The **Model Catalog** in the RHOAI Dashboard is still showing only the public Red Hat default models.

We need to apply the "Bridge" — the `ModelCatalogSource` configuration we discussed in the Architecture section.

. **Apply the Catalog Configuration:**
+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f deploy/catalog/catalog-source.yaml
----

. **Verify the Link:**
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get configmap -n redhat-ods-applications -l opendatahub.io/dashboard=true
----

== Step 4: Final Verification

1.  Open your **Red Hat OpenShift AI Dashboard** in your browser.
2.  Navigate to the **Model Catalog** tab in the left sidebar.
3.  Look for a new section or tab (depending on UI version) labeled **"Private Enterprise Registry"**.
4.  **Success:** You should see the card for **"Granite 7B Enterprise"**.
5.  Click the card. Notice that the deployment source is **NOT** Hugging Face. It is your private S3 bucket URI.

*Congratulations! You have successfully built a private AI Supply Chain. You are no longer dependent on public hubs.*
